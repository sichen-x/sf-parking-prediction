# Overview
By leveraging [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)'s machine learning technology, this project is for predicting if at least one parking spot is available at a particular location and time in San Francisco. This is a project for Kaggle challenge [Parking in SF](https://www.kaggle.com/c/parking-in-sf/). Our team name is "Parkour PARKOUR" whose position in the Leaderboard is 17/41 in the public board, and 21/41 in the private.
